Tattooed suburban dad of twins with too many hobbies.  
Somewhere between school drop-offs, the home gym, and cars & coffee, I run a homelab and break/fix Linux systems for fun (usually on purpose).

I’m a systems engineer focused on **practical Linux infrastructure**, **reproducible setups**, and **clear documentation**. Most of what’s here reflects things I actually use and maintain.

## 🔧 What lives here

- Linux system administration notes (RHEL, Fedora, Debian)
- Containers & VMs: Podman (rootless), Proxmox, ZFS, backups
- Shell scripts, setup tooling, window manager docs
- Dotfiles, daily-driver configs, homelab wiki
- Websites & photography projects (static sites and experiments)

Some repos are polished, some are works in progress — all are real.
