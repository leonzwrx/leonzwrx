# 👋 Welcome

Tattooed suburban dad of twins with too many hobbies.  
Somewhere between school drop-offs, home gym, and cars & coffees, I run a homelab and break/fix Linux systems for fun.

I’m a systems engineer focused on **practical linux infrastructure**, **reproducible setups**, and **clear documentation** — most of what’s here reflects things I actively use and maintain.

---

## 🔧 What I store here

- Personal Linux system administration guides & notes(RHEL, Fedora, Debian, etc)
- Containerization & VM configs: Podman (rootless), Proxmox, ZFS, backups
- Helpful shell scripts, setup scripts, window manager docs
- dotfiles, daily-driven configs, homelab documentation & wiki etc
- website & photography projects - statics sites and experiments 

Some repos are polished, some are works in progress — all are real.
